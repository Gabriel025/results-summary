## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Kind of)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Besides the practical experience, I learned how to make a gradient for a background. Example of one that I used below.

```css
.result-div {
    background: linear-gradient(hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
}
```

### Continued development

I think the main thing i need to improve is making the design more responsive to a wide variety of screen sizes. There were problably better ways to do what i did here.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - This helped me with the gradients used on the left side
